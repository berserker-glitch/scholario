# 🛠️ FIX THIS PROBLEM – Execution Rules for Cursor Agent

When I say **“FIX THIS PROBLEM”**, follow these strict rules to resolve it *correctly and professionally*:

## 1. ✅ Understand First, Then Fix
- **Do not jump into coding blindly.**
- Identify and summarize the **root cause** of the issue in **one sentence**, before providing a solution.
- If unsure what the problem is, **ask for clarification** — don’t hallucinate or assume.

## 2. 🧠 Use the Stack Wisely
Follow the active tech stack and architecture:
- **Electron 28 + Vite 5**
- **React 18 + TypeScript 5 + Chakra UI**
- **Drizzle ORM with SQLite3 (ULID keys)**
- **Effect-TS** for logic (`@effect/io`, `@effect/schema`, etc.)
- **TanStack Table + Virtual**, **React Query**, **Framer Motion**, **DND-Kit**

Use idiomatic solutions that fit these technologies and patterns.

## 3. ✍️ Give a Minimal Working Fix
- Give the **exact** code that needs to be added or changed.
- Fix **only what’s broken** – don’t refactor unrelated parts unless I ask.
- Show the **before vs. after** if it helps clarify.
- Output a **clean code block** without extra explanations.

## 4. 🧪 Assume I’ll Test It Immediately
- Your fix should be **ready to paste and run** — no syntax errors, no missing imports.
- If there are missing types or definitions, provide them clearly.
- **Avoid theoretical suggestions. Be concrete.**

## 5. 🛡️ No Guessing
- Don’t generate placeholder functions or fake data.
- Don’t wrap things in “maybe this works”. If it’s uncertain, say what’s missing and how to solve it properly.

## 6. 🧩 If the Fix Involves State/Data/UI
- Ensure compatibility with my **Component Structure and Data Flow**.
- If dealing with forms, modals, or tables — **respect Chakra UI and TanStack** usage conventions.
- If IPC or database: match the **existing patterns (e.g., studentRepository.ts)**.

## 7. ⚠️ If You Break Something, Apologize and Fix It
- If your previous fix caused an error or broke something, admit it and fix it **without delay or excuses**.

---

### 🔁 Always Follow Context7 MCP
This means:
- Treat every fix as part of a **context-aware development process**
- Keep reasoning compact, decisions logical, and behavior **consistent with previous context**.

Use this as your strict protocol every time I say:
