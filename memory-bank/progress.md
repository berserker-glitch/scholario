## Known Issues

1. ✅ **Fixed: Student Creation Issue**: Student creation not working when clicking save button
   - Root cause: handleCreateStudent function not properly calling createStudent
   - Fixed by properly implementing the event handler

2. ✅ **Fixed: Student Update Issue**: Student updates not being saved to the database
   - Root cause: Method overriding conflict in StudentRepository class
   - Fixed by replacing the override method with a properly implemented update method
   - Enhanced error handling and logging in the update process

3. ✅ **Fixed: Component Errors**: Chakra UI StatNumber component errors  
   - Fixed by wrapping components in Stat parents

4. ✅ **Fixed: Student Data Access**: "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'student')" error
   - Fixed with robust error handling and mock data implementation

5. ✅ **Fixed: SQLite Native Module**: Loading issues with better-sqlite3
   - Implemented alternative loading paths and better diagnostics

6. ✅ **Fixed: Preload Script Error**: "Unable to load preload script: main/preload.ts"
   - Created a CommonJS preload.js file and updated BrowserWindow configuration

7. ✅ **Fixed: Dashboard Display**: Updated dashboard to only show active students count
   - Removed kicked students from the total student count
   - Simplified student statistics display

8. ✅ **Fixed: Database Schema Mismatch**: "table students has no column named first_name" error
   - Fixed mismatched column naming conventions between the Drizzle schema (snake_case) and SQL table creation statements (camelCase)
   - Updated SQL CREATE TABLE statements to use snake_case for column names to match the schema definition
   - Deleted existing database file to allow recreation with correct schema

9. ✅ **Fixed: Subject Page Rendering**: "Cannot access 'filteredSubjects' before initialization" error
   - Root cause: Variable reference order in SubjectsPage component - using filteredSubjects in a useEffect before it was defined
   - Fixed by moving the debug useEffect after the filteredSubjects variable declaration
   - Created a direct database access API as emergency fallback for reliable subjects data retrieval

10. **Remaining Type Errors**:
   - StudentTable.tsx column definitions need fixing
   - Effect.ts typing needs three type arguments in some locations
