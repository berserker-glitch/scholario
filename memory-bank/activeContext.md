# Scholario Active Context

## Current Focus

The development focus is currently on stabilizing the application by fixing critical issues, enhancing the user interface with a proper sidebar navigation, and implementing dashboard analytics.

### Recent Changes

1. **UI Enhancements**:
   - Added sidebar navigation with icons for improved application flow
   - Implemented dashboard analytics with statistics cards
   - Improved organization of student information in detail views
   - Enhanced form usability and validation
   - Updated student table columns to show CNI, School, and Study Year instead of Status, Email, and Actions

2. **Critical Fixes**:
   - Fixed dashboard error by removing groups display (SqliteError: no such column: schedule)
   - Fixed subject page rendering issue that prevented subjects from displaying (ReferenceError: Cannot access 'filteredSubjects' before initialization)
   - Created direct database access API as emergency fallback for subjects data retrieval
   - Fixed student update functionality that wasn't saving changes to the database
   - Fixed student creation functionality that was not working when clicking save button
   - Resolved Chakra UI component errors by properly nesting StatNumber within Stat components
   - Fixed "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'student')" error with robust error handling
   - Implemented mock data system when the API or database isn't available
   - Added SQLite connection fallbacks and better error diagnostics
   - Fixed preload script error by creating a CommonJS preload.js file
   - Resolved database schema mismatch by aligning SQL CREATE TABLE column names (snake_case) with Drizzle schema definitions

3. **Architectural Improvements**:
   - Enhanced error handling throughout the application
   - Implemented robust module loading paths for native dependencies
   - Improved IPC communication between main and renderer processes
   - Added better diagnostics for database connection issues
   - Refactored student repository to fix method overriding issues causing update failures

### Next Steps

1. **Complete Student Management Features**:
   - Finish subject and group assignment functionality for students
   - Implement remaining bulk actions for student management
   - Enhance filtering options for student lists

2. **Fix Remaining Type Errors**:
   - Address linting errors in `StudentTable.tsx` related to column definitions
   - Fix Effect.ts type arguments in repositories

3. **Subject and Group Management**:
   - Begin implementing subject CRUD operations
   - Create group management interface
   - Develop subject/group assignment workflow

## Active Decisions

1. **Error Handling Strategy**:
   - Implemented graceful degradation with mock data when database connection fails
   - Added comprehensive error handling in UI components
   - Ensured user-friendly error messages through toast notifications

2. **UI Navigation Approach**:
   - Adopted a sidebar navigation pattern for better application organization
   - Implemented dashboard as the central landing page with key metrics
   - Used consistent iconography for improved usability

3. **Database Robustness**:
   - Implemented multiple fallback paths for loading SQLite native modules
   - Added better diagnostics for database connection issues
   - Created mock data implementation as fallback when database is unavailable
   - Improved repository pattern implementation to avoid method overriding conflicts

## Current Challenges

1. **Remaining Type Errors**:
   - Several TypeScript errors still need to be addressed in table components
   - Effect.ts typing needs three type arguments in some locations

2. **Feature Expansion**:
   - Need to implement subject and group management functionality
   - Payment tracking and financial management features need development
   - Reporting capabilities required for administrative oversight

3. **Testing Strategy**:
   - Need more comprehensive testing for database fallback mechanisms
   - UI testing required for new components
   - End-to-end testing needed for critical user flows
